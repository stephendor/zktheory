      ### Group Theory Concepts

      **Cayley Graphs** provide a powerful way to visualize the structure of finite groups. In a Cayley graph:

      - Each **vertex** represents a group element
      - **Directed edges** show the action of generators  
      - The graph structure reveals **group properties**

      **Key Properties Explored:**

      - **Order**: Number of elements in the group
      - **Generators**: Minimal set of elements that generate the entire group
      - **Relations**: Fundamental equations defining the group
      - **Conjugacy Classes**: Sets of elements related by conjugation
      - **Center**: Elements that commute with all group elements
      - **Subgroups**: Smaller groups contained within the larger group
      - **Cosets**: Partitions of the group formed by a subgroup
      - **Normal Subgroups**: Special subgroups where left and right cosets coincide

      ### Supported Group Families

      #### Cyclic Groups (Cₙ)
      The simplest groups, generated by a single element of order n.
      - **Properties**: Always abelian, subgroups correspond to divisors
      - **Examples**: C₃ (triangle rotations), C₄ (square rotations)

      #### Dihedral Groups (Dₙ)
      Symmetries of regular n-gons, including rotations and reflections.
      - **Order**: 2n elements
      - **Structure**: n rotations + n reflections
      - **Applications**: Crystal symmetries, geometric transformations

      #### Symmetric Groups (Sₙ)
      All permutations of n elements.
      - **S₃**: 6 elements, non-abelian
      - **Applications**: Solving polynomial equations, combinatorics

      #### Special Groups
      - **Klein Four Group (V₄)**: Elementary abelian group of order 4
      - **Quaternion Group (Q₈)**: Non-abelian group modeling quaternion multiplication
      - **Alternating Group (A₄)**: Even permutations, tetrahedral symmetries

      ### Understanding Subgroups and Cosets

      #### What are Subgroups?
      A **subgroup** H of a group G is a subset that is itself a group under the same operation. Every group has at least two subgroups: the trivial subgroup {e} containing only the identity, and the group itself.

      **Key Properties:**
      - Must contain the identity element
      - Must be closed under the group operation
      - Must contain inverses of all its elements

      #### What are Cosets?
      Given a subgroup H of group G, the **left cosets** of H are sets of the form gH = {gh : h ∈ H} for each element g ∈ G.

      **Important Facts:**
      - Cosets partition the entire group (every element belongs to exactly one coset)
      - All cosets have the same size as the subgroup H
      - The number of cosets equals |G|/|H| (Lagrange's Theorem)

      #### Normal Subgroups
      A subgroup N is **normal** if gN = Ng for all g ∈ G (left cosets equal right cosets). Normal subgroups are special because:
      - They allow us to form quotient groups G/N
      - The cosets themselves form a group structure
      - They correspond to kernel of group homomorphisms
