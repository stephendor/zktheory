      Explore the interconnected world of mathematics through our interactive concept mapping interface. 
      This visualization reveals the deep connections between different mathematical domains, showing how 
      concepts in elliptic curves, abstract algebra, and topology relate to each other.

      **Features:**
      - **Force-directed graph visualization** using D3.js for natural concept clustering
      - **Interactive filtering** by mathematical category and difficulty level
      - **Detailed concept tooltips** with definitions, examples, and properties
      - **Learning pathway discovery** to understand prerequisite relationships
      - **Educational progression tracking** for structured mathematical learning

      Navigate through the mathematical landscape by clicking on concepts, filtering by categories, 
      or following suggested learning paths. Each concept shows its mathematical properties, 
      examples, and connections to other areas of mathematics.
