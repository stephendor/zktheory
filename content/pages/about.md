    subtitle: Aspiring cryptography and formal verification specialist
    text: >
      I'm currently completing a degree in Mathematics, with a particular
      fascination for abstract algebra and the elegance of mathematical proof.
      This blog documents my journey exploring how these interests connect with
      practical programming - from theorem proving in Lean 4 to cryptographic
      implementations in Rust. I'm drawn to the intersection where mathematical
      rigor meets real-world code.
