Retreat Descriptions

A chance to spend a weekend in this wonderful location, with time and space to focus on yoga & meditation practice and to simply be.​  No prior experience of meditation is needed.  We will be taking inspiration from the landscape around us - the stillness and majesty of the mountains, the presence of the lake, the green spring flora and the elements of the weather, whatever that may be!  We will let the inspiration from nature support and inform our practice on the mat, with the aim of rejuvenation for body and mind from this peaceful setting, as well as our sessions together.   There will be free time for walking, or swimming in the lake, or simply sitting in the garden enjoying the view.  The location would also make an excellent jumping off point for a longer stay over the Easter holidays in Snowdonia.  The area has so much to offer and the beautiful North Wales coast, including the Llyn peninsula is also close by.

A relaxed weekend of yoga practice, good food and good company in beautiful surroundings in Worcestershire.  A chance to drink in some seasonal delights in the English countryside.  The Fold is a lovely venue - a community farm, with it's own cafe and artists' studios, as well as the converted barn where our yoga sessions will take place.  There is a choice of local accommodation from onsite camping to a very comfortable hotel across the road.  Evening catering is provided by our very own Manasi Nandi, at a private location nearby.  After a lovely visit in May this year we are very lucky to be invited to back to this lovely corner of the country in August 2025!  Read on for full details and booking.  

Private Sessions
 
​Private sessions can be taken on an ongoing basis, as a short series or even as a one-off treat.  A blend of Scaravelli-inspired Yoga & Gentle Somatic Movement tailored to your individual needs.  Weekly availability in Colwyn Bay and surrounding areas, North Wales.  Monthly availability in London.  I come to you, so that you can practice in the comfort of your own home.  Alternatively you are welcome to come to my cosy dedicated yoga space in Old Colwyn.  Either have a solo session, or get together with a friend or two and split the cost below.  Also available online via zoom. 


About Anna:


Hello, I'm Anna!   I attended my first yoga class in Osmington, Dorset in 1993 and instantly fell in love with the practice of connecting body, mind and spirit through movement, breath and asana.  Ever since then yoga has been a central feature in my life.  In my late teens and early adulthood becoming a yoga teacher was my dream and after more than a decade of dedicated practice I found the teacher training course I had been waiting for:  the Scaravelli Inspired AIYP London Teacher Training Course (BWY accredited) which gave me a solid grounding in the principles of Vanda Scaravelli's approach and also inspired me to keep on learning and to develop my own unique style of teaching. I qualified in 2011 and have been on a wonderful journey of teaching groups and individuals since then.  

I am ever humbled by the way in which my own yoga and meditation practice helps me to navigate the changing seas and seasons of life.  The holistic path of yoga has quite simply been my rock from teenage years to midlife; it has carried me with grace through challenging times.  Sharing this beautiful practice with others gives me great joy and I feel incredibly lucky to be able to do what I love each day.
​ 
I met my husband Stephen in 2017 and together we moved to North Wales in 2020.  The beautiful natural landscape here is a constant inspiration and I love both wild swimming and exploring on land, drawing inspiration from Embodied Presence practices. 

Stephen introduced me to Zen meditation and also to the beautiful Mevlevi Order of Sufism.  These are now two of the finest threads in the weave of my personal spiritual path, filling me with gratitude, wonder and awe, along with the understanding that I am always a beginner.  

Stephen sometimes joins me leading meditation in workshops, retreats and classes, lending his wisdom and many years of experience to our sessions.  

What to expect in a class
​
Take a moment where you are right now.  Can you feel your feet on the ground?  Can you feel the breath moving in your belly or rib cage?  Can you feel the natural curves of your spine and the gentle reach of the crown of your head skywards?  The principles of surrendering to gravity and connecting to the breath are key in the style of yoga that I practice and teach.  We work gently, softly, slowly and tend to our bodies with utmost care, compassion and respect. 

I am most inspired by the pioneering work of female post-lineage yogis such as Vanda Scaravelli, Angela Farmer, Donna Fahri and Donna Martin (Psoma Yoga Therapy).   The 2 year teacher training I undertook was led by a faculty of diverse, highly experienced practitioners:  Chloe Freemantle, Anne-Marie Zulkahari, Giovanni Felicioni, Pete Blackaby (Intelligent Yoga) & Lisa Mcrory.  With respect and gratitude to all of the above.  You can click on the names to find out more about some of the work that has influenced me.  

In a class you will be encouraged to work at your own pace and to cultivate a friendly curiosity towards the body as you explore different movements and poses.  

As Donna Fahri says, "The teacher’s role is to be the agent for guiding the student to their own perception, thoughts, feelings, kinesthesia and insights."   My aim is for the class to offer you a space where you feel free to be yourself and to meet yourself exactly where you are.   



Vanda Scaravelli 

I often wonder what it would have been like to meet and work with Vanda personally.  Her approach informed my teacher training and and my practice and teaching style to this day.  What characterises this practice? 

Vanda believed in the natural wisdom of the body and in the unraveling release that we can find through careful practice.  Three practice 'friends' - Gravity, The Spine & The Breath, make everything possible. 

The lower half of the body learns to root down into the ground and to be become anchored and strong.  The upper half of the body meanwhile becomes more fluid and free.  

This beautiful article The Legacy of Vanda Scaravelli by Nan Wishner is well worth a read.  

Some blog writing

his picture above was painted recently by my Dad, who took up painting later in life, attending classes at The Studio Art School run by my cousin Justin, down on the south coast in Dorset.  Art Classes at Upwey | thestudioartschool

On seeing this one I was immediately struck by the similarity with the famous 'lone tree' of Llyn Padarn, near where I live, 300 miles away. 

​What an incredible location for this tree to survive in. 
Picture
Up here in North Wales I recently visited another famous tree.  This ancient yew tree has been estimated to be a mind-boggling 4000 years old!! ​

Picture
You just can't help but feel a sense of reverence and awe in the presence of this ancient yew.  It sits in a church yard now, but of course it predates Christianity by about half of it's lifetime!  
Picture
On the same day we also came across this pair of trees with their beautifully entwined root systems, exposed for us to appreciate a little of what is going on underground!

​
	
I love to bring images of trees to mind during my yoga practice, finding inspiration in root systems such as these. 

What if our feet could grow roots just like the ones above? 

​​The more we can gain an embodied sense of growing our roots downwards, the more we gain stability in the body and perhaps more steadiness of mind at the same time. ​​
As Vanda Scaravelli reminds us, "The pull of gravity under our feet makes it possible for us to extend the upper part of the spine, and this extension allows us to release tension between the vertebrae.  Gravity is like a magnet attracting us to the earth, but this attraction is not limited to pulling us down, it also allows us to stretch in the opposite direction towards the sky."  (Awakening The Spine, 1991). 

So, through dedicated practice, we find ourselves standing tall and perhaps also carrying ourselves with greater confidence and ease.  A kind of confidence that has nothing to do with ego and everything to do with simply claiming one's place alongside all other living things, with a sense of equanimity, inspired by the trees. 



The yoga mat as a training ground for life..

23/11/2023

 
Picture
I often consider time spent on the yoga mat to be a kind of ‘training ground’ for life.  What do I mean by this?  Let’s say that during a simple movement exploration (coming in and out of a seated twist for example, or moving between dog pose and plank a few times) we ask ourselves, ‘How does this feel? Does my body want to go slower with this movement? Or does it need to speed up?  Where exactly do I need to stop in order to respect any given part of the body and work safely, whilst perhaps also bringing in a satisfying level of challenge..?'`

This process of paying close attention to our responses and impulses moment by moment can give us useful information about our lives off the mat.  Perhaps you notice that there’s a part of yourself that is never satisfied, always striving for more, or you notice that there’s a conflict between your felt sense and a habitual thought pattern telling you something like:
​‘I must fit in and do what everyone else is doing.’   This witnessing of ourselves and our patterns of thought is something that can lead us into deeper practice.  Self study, or Svadhyaya, is one of the Niyamas (inner observances) from the ancient yogic texts.  And the yoga mat offers a kind of laboratory for our study, should we wish to embark on the journey of self-discovery.

At this point in writing I paused for a 1-2-1 session on zoom. In our opening chat my student shared how she had had an insight during the week about how her yoga practice could inform life off the mat as well. The timing really made me smile as I had just finished writing the paragraph above moments earlier! My student had realised that just as we have choice about how to approach and when to stop in any particular yoga pose we also have choice about situations in life.  Importantly perhaps we can choose when and how to move towards and when to step back from a situation, with more clarity, after honing our skills and awareness on the yoga mat. 

This increase in levels of self awareness and therefore choice in all areas of life is one of the most profound and life changing benefits of a yoga practice. 

Does any of this resonate with you?  Let me know in the comments
