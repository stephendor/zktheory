Since I can’t generate a live Figma file directly here, I’ll give you a **pixel-perfect wireframe blueprint** that can be pasted into Figma as a **frame structure with named layers**, so a designer can instantly lay it out visually.

I’ll format it in a way that matches Figma’s “Frame → Named Layer → Text/Image Placeholder” hierarchy, with exact placements for your quoted text blocks.

## **Notes for Designer**

* Quoted text layers should be **locked** so the designer cannot accidentally edit them.
* Placeholder images should be tagged `#IMAGE` + type for easy replacement.
* Keep enough whitespace to preserve the “spacious” feel.
* Avoid heavy shadows; use soft blurs for depth.

If you want, I can now **convert this wireframe blueprint into an SVG/PNG grey-box mockup** so you or your designer can drag it straight into Figma and start replacing placeholders.
That way you wouldn’t have to build the layout manually in Figma from this spec.

Do you want me to generate that mockup file?
