## üî¨ Mathematical Background

### Cayley Graphs

A Cayley graph G(G,S) for a group G and generating set S is a directed graph where:

- Vertices represent group elements
- Edges connect g to gs for each generator s ‚àà S and group element g

### Key Properties

- **Connectivity**: Reflects group structure
- **Regularity**: Each vertex has the same degree
- **Color Coding**: Different generators use different colors
- **Symmetry**: Graph symmetries relate to group symmetries

### Educational Applications

- **Group Structure**: Visualize how generators create the entire group
- **Subgroups**: See how subgroups form connected components or paths
- **Cosets**: Understand quotient group structure
- **Normal Subgroups**: Identify special subgroup relationships

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Component Structure

```
CayleyGraphExplorer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CayleyGraphExplorer.tsx    # Main React component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                   # Component exports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                     # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Integration Points

- **GenericSection**: Modified to detect and render Cayley graph sections
- **Markdown Processing**: Custom handling for interactive content
- **Styling**: Tailwind classes for consistent design
- **Navigation**: Integrated with site routing and SEO

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface GraphData {
  vertices: Array<{
    id: string;
    x: number;
    y: number;
    label: string;
    color: string;
  }>;
  edges: Array<{
    source: string;
    target: string;
    color: string;
  }>;
}
```

## üìö Usage Examples

### Symmetric Group S‚ÇÉ

```
Group Type: SymmetricGroup
Parameter: 3
Generators: (1,2), (1,2,3)
```

This generates the complete symmetric group on 3 elements with:

- 6 vertices (all permutations)
- Red edges for transposition generator
- Green edges for 3-cycle generator

### Educational Workflow

1. **Generate Graph**: Start with S‚ÇÉ example
2. **Explore Structure**: Identify different element types
3. **Highlight Subgroups**: Study cyclic subgroups
4. **Analyze Cosets**: Understand quotient structure
5. **Find Center**: Identify special elements
