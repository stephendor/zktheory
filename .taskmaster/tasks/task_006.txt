# Task ID: 6
# Title: Integrate Research Demonstration Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement interactive demonstrations showcasing 98.42% APT detection and 60% bubble detection research results
# Details:
Create demonstration components that reproduce published research results with interactive parameter adjustment. Implement side-by-side comparison views, downloadable datasets, and reproducible pipeline execution. Add performance benchmarking visualizations using Chart.js.

# Test Strategy:
Verify research result reproduction accuracy, test parameter adjustment responsiveness, validate dataset downloads, and ensure benchmark visualization correctness

# Subtasks:
