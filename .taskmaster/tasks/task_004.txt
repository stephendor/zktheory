# Task ID: 4
# Title: Enhance TDA Visualizer with Realistic Improvements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Expand the TDA Explorer's visualization capabilities with achievable enhancements that add real value without complex WASM integration
# Details:
Focus on enhancing the existing TDA visualizer with realistic improvements including better point cloud generation, interactive persistence diagrams, enhanced barcode visualizations, and improved mapper functionality. Avoid complex WASM integration that has proven problematic and focus on JavaScript-based enhancements that work reliably. NOTE: Layout improvements implemented (collapsible menus, compact info sections) but need further iteration - mark for attention later when we can dedicate more time to perfecting the UI layout.

# Test Strategy:
Test all new visualization features work without breaking existing functionality, verify performance remains sub-100ms, validate user experience improvements, and ensure mobile compatibility

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enhanced Point Cloud Generation and Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add more sophisticated point cloud generation methods and improved visualization features
### Details:
Implement additional point cloud generation methods (Gaussian clusters, circles, torus, etc.). Add color-coding for points by density or distance. Implement point labels and tooltips. Add different point cloud presets for common TDA scenarios. Ensure all new features work with existing computation pipeline.

## 2. Interactive Persistence Diagram Enhancements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve the persistence diagram with interactive features and better visual representation
### Details:
Add confidence intervals or statistical significance indicators. Implement color-coding by dimension (H0, H1, H2). Add filtering by persistence length with interactive controls. Implement zoom and pan functionality. Add dimension labels and persistence statistics display. Ensure all features work smoothly with existing data.

## 3. Enhanced Persistence Barcode Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve the persistence barcode with better interactivity and visual clarity
### Details:
Make barcode bars interactive with click-to-highlight functionality. Add clear dimension labels (H0, H1, H2). Implement color-coding by dimension. Add persistence statistics and summary information. Implement filtering and sorting options. Ensure the barcode remains readable at all zoom levels.

## 4. Improved Mapper Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the mapper visualization with better clustering and interaction capabilities
### Details:
Add different clustering algorithm options. Improve nerve complex visualization clarity. Implement interactive node selection and highlighting. Add color-coding by various metrics (density, persistence, etc.). Implement better layout algorithms for complex networks. Add tooltips and information panels for selected elements.

## 5. Data Input and Export Improvements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add better data handling capabilities and export functionality
### Details:
Implement file upload for CSV/JSON point clouds. Add more sophisticated point generation controls with parameter presets. Implement data export functionality for persistence results. Add screenshot and visualization export capabilities. Create parameter presets for common TDA scenarios. Ensure all file operations work reliably across browsers.

## 6. Performance Monitoring and Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add performance monitoring and optimize existing visualizations for better responsiveness
### Details:
Implement performance monitoring for visualization rendering. Add frame rate monitoring and performance warnings. Optimize existing D3.js visualizations for better performance. Implement lazy loading for large datasets. Add performance settings for different device capabilities. Ensure all optimizations maintain visual quality.
