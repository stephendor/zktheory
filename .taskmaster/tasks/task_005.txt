# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build 3D Persistence Landscape Visualizations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create interactive 3D visualizations for topological persistence landscapes using Three.js
# Details:
Extend the existing TDAExplorer with React Three Fiber to render 3D persistence landscapes. Implement camera controls for orbit navigation, color mapping for persistence values, and overlay capabilities for multiple landscapes. Add WebGL optimizations for smooth 60 FPS rendering.

# Test Strategy:
Test 3D rendering performance across browsers, verify camera controls responsiveness, validate color mapping accuracy, and ensure mobile device compatibility

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate React Three Fiber with TDAExplorer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up React Three Fiber canvas within the existing TDAExplorer component and establish the basic 3D scene structure for persistence landscape rendering
### Details:
Add React Three Fiber canvas to TDAExplorer, configure scene lighting and basic mesh setup, ensure proper integration with existing React state management

## 2. Implement 3D Persistence Landscape Geometry [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create Three.js geometry generation for persistence landscapes using topological data, including mesh construction and surface interpolation
### Details:
Build geometry generation functions that convert persistence data to 3D mesh vertices, implement surface smoothing algorithms, create wireframe and solid rendering modes

## 3. Add Camera Controls and Navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement orbit controls for 3D scene navigation with smooth camera movement and zoom functionality
### Details:
Integrate OrbitControls for camera manipulation, add smooth zoom and pan capabilities, implement view reset functionality and camera position presets

## 4. Develop Color Mapping System [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create dynamic color mapping for persistence values with customizable color scales and gradient visualization
### Details:
Implement color gradient mapping based on persistence values, add color scale selection UI, create legend components for value interpretation

## 5. Optimize WebGL Performance and Multi-Landscape Overlay [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement WebGL optimizations for 60 FPS rendering and add capability to overlay multiple persistence landscapes simultaneously
### Details:
Add level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, implement frustum culling, create multi-landscape blending modes, optimize shader performance, add transparency controls
