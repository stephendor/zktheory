# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Mathematical Bridge Visualizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop interactive diagrams showing connections between elliptic curves, abstract algebra, and topology
# Details:
Build animated transformation components using D3.js and React to show relationships between mathematical concepts. Implement concept mapping interfaces, animated morphisms between structures, and interactive transformation controls with step-by-step progression.

# Test Strategy:
Test animation smoothness and mathematical accuracy, verify concept relationships display correctly, validate interaction controls, and ensure educational clarity

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Animated Transformation Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create D3.js-based animated components that show mathematical transformations between elliptic curves, abstract algebra, and topology concepts
### Details:
Build reusable React components with D3.js integration for smooth mathematical transformations. Implement morphing animations between different mathematical structures, coordinate system transitions, and parametric curve animations. Ensure 60 FPS performance and responsive design.

## 2. Build Concept Mapping Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop interactive interface for mapping relationships between mathematical concepts with node-link diagrams
### Details:
Create force-directed graph layout using D3.js to visualize connections between elliptic curves, algebraic structures, and topological spaces. Implement drag-and-drop functionality, zoom controls, and concept filtering. Add tooltips with mathematical definitions and properties.

## 3. Implement Animated Morphisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create animations showing morphisms and homomorphisms between mathematical structures
### Details:
Build animated sequences demonstrating structure-preserving maps between algebraic objects and topological spaces. Implement step-by-step morphism visualization with pause/play controls, variable speed adjustment, and mathematical notation overlays.

## 4. Develop Interactive Transformation Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Build user interface controls for manipulating mathematical transformations and parameters
### Details:
Create control panels with sliders, input fields, and preset configurations for mathematical parameters. Implement real-time parameter adjustment with immediate visual feedback, parameter validation, and mathematical constraint checking.

## 5. Add Step-by-Step Educational Progression [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Implement guided progression system for educational clarity with explanatory text and visual cues
### Details:
Build tutorial system with progressive disclosure of mathematical concepts, step-by-step explanations, and interactive checkpoints. Add mathematical notation rendering, concept glossary integration, and progress tracking for educational pathways.
