# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Unified Navigation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a seamless navigation system connecting all mathematical tools and research demonstrations
# Details:
Build a hierarchical navigation component with contextual cross-references between Cayley graphs, TDA explorer, and documentation. Implement progressive disclosure UI patterns and breadcrumb navigation. Add search functionality across all content using Algolia integration. Create navigation state management with Zustand.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation flow between all tools, verify search results accuracy, validate accessibility with keyboard navigation, and ensure mobile responsiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Hierarchical Navigation Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational navigation component architecture with proper hierarchy support for mathematical tools and documentation sections
### Details:
Design and implement the core navigation component structure using React and TypeScript. Define navigation hierarchy for Cayley graphs, TDA explorer, documentation, and research demonstrations. Create responsive navigation layouts for desktop and mobile. Establish component props interface and styling with Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Implement Contextual Cross-References Between Tools [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Build intelligent cross-referencing system that connects related mathematical concepts across different tools
### Details:
Implement contextual linking system between Cayley graphs and TDA explorer tools. Create metadata mapping for mathematical concepts and their relationships. Build suggestion engine for related content discovery. Add hover tooltips and inline references for seamless navigation between tools.

## 3. Build Progressive Disclosure UI Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement progressive disclosure patterns with breadcrumb navigation for complex mathematical content hierarchy
### Details:
Create collapsible navigation sections with smooth animations using Framer Motion. Implement breadcrumb component with proper hierarchy visualization. Build expandable menu items with nested content support. Add keyboard navigation support and ARIA labels for accessibility compliance.

## 4. Integrate Algolia Search Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive search across all mathematical tools, documentation, and research content using existing Algolia integration
### Details:
Configure Algolia search indices for mathematical content, documentation, and tool descriptions. Implement search UI component with autocomplete and filtering capabilities. Add search result highlighting and contextual previews. Create search analytics tracking for content optimization.

## 5. Create Zustand State Management for Navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement centralized navigation state management using Zustand for consistent navigation experience across the application
### Details:
Set up Zustand store for navigation state including current location, breadcrumb history, and user preferences. Implement navigation actions for programmatic routing and state updates. Add persistence layer for navigation preferences and recent searches. Create navigation middleware for analytics and performance tracking.
