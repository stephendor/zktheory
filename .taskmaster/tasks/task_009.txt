# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Academic Integration Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Add BibTeX citation generation, DOI linking, and reproducibility certificates for demonstrations
# Details:
Implement academic citation tools with BibTeX format generation, DOI resolution integration, and metadata management for demonstrations. Add export functionality for computational results in CSV/JSON formats and figure export in vector graphics.

# Test Strategy:
Test citation format accuracy, verify DOI link resolution, validate export file formats, and ensure metadata completeness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create BibTeX Citation Generation System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a comprehensive BibTeX citation generation system that automatically creates properly formatted citations for demonstrations and computational results
### Details:
Build citation generation components that support standard BibTeX entry types (article, inproceedings, techreport). Create metadata extraction from demonstration results and research findings. Implement citation field validation and formatting according to BibTeX standards. Add user interface for citation preview and editing.

## 2. Add DOI Resolution Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate DOI linking functionality to connect demonstrations with published research papers and external academic resources
### Details:
Implement DOI resolution API integration using CrossRef or similar services. Create DOI validation and link generation components. Add automatic DOI detection from research metadata and demonstration parameters. Build fallback mechanisms for invalid or expired DOIs.

## 3. Implement Metadata Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build a comprehensive metadata management system for tracking demonstration parameters, results, and reproducibility information
### Details:
Create metadata schemas for computational demonstrations including input parameters, algorithm versions, and execution environment. Implement metadata storage and retrieval using IndexedDB. Add version tracking for reproducibility certificates. Build metadata export functionality in JSON and XML formats.

## 4. Build Multi-Format Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive export capabilities for computational results in CSV/JSON formats and figures in vector graphics formats
### Details:
Create export components for computational results supporting CSV, JSON, and XML formats. Implement SVG and PDF export for mathematical visualizations and charts. Add batch export functionality for multiple demonstrations. Build export preview with format validation and file size optimization.
