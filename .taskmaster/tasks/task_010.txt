# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Performance Monitoring Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create real-time performance monitoring for mathematical computations and visualizations
# Details:
Build performance dashboard using React and Chart.js to monitor WASM computation times, rendering frame rates, and memory usage. Implement alerts for performance degradation and optimization recommendations based on usage patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify performance metric accuracy, test alert system responsiveness, validate dashboard real-time updates, and ensure minimal performance impact

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Performance Metrics Collection Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for collecting mathematical computation and visualization performance data
### Details:
Design a performance metrics collection system that captures WASM computation times, rendering frame rates, memory usage patterns, and user interaction latency. Implement performance hooks for mathematical components (Cayley graphs, TDA visualizations, LaTeX rendering). Create a metrics buffer system to handle high-frequency data collection without impacting performance.

## 2. Implement Real-time Performance Dashboard UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the React-based dashboard interface using Chart.js for visualizing performance metrics
### Details:
Create a responsive dashboard layout with real-time charts for computation performance, rendering metrics, and memory usage. Implement Chart.js components for time-series data visualization. Add performance trend analysis with moving averages and anomaly detection. Include mathematical-specific performance indicators like LaTeX compilation time and WASM function execution duration.

## 3. Integrate Performance Monitoring with Mathematical Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add performance hooks to all mathematical visualization and computation components
### Details:
Integrate performance monitoring hooks into Cayley graph rendering, TDA explorer computations, MathJax/LaTeX rendering, and WASM function calls. Implement performance measurement for mathematical algorithm execution times. Add memory usage tracking for large mathematical datasets and visualization objects. Create performance correlation between user interactions and computation complexity.

## 4. Implement Performance Alert System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create intelligent alerting for performance degradation and optimization recommendations
### Details:
Build an alert system that monitors performance thresholds and triggers notifications for degradation. Implement machine learning-based anomaly detection for mathematical computation patterns. Create optimization recommendations based on performance trends and usage patterns. Add alert configuration for different mathematical tool performance expectations.

## 5. Add Performance Data Export and Analysis Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create tools for exporting performance data and conducting detailed performance analysis
### Details:
Implement CSV/JSON export functionality for performance metrics data. Create performance analysis tools for identifying bottlenecks in mathematical computations. Add performance comparison features between different mathematical tools and algorithms. Build performance benchmarking tools for mathematical visualization rendering.

## 6. Optimize Dashboard Performance and Minimize Overhead [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the performance monitoring system itself has minimal impact on mathematical computations
### Details:
Implement efficient data collection with minimal overhead using performance.now() and requestAnimationFrame. Add data sampling strategies to reduce monitoring impact on high-frequency operations. Implement lazy loading for dashboard components and optimize Chart.js rendering. Add performance monitoring toggle for production vs development environments.
