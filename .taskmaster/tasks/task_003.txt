# Task ID: 3
# Title: Enhance Existing Cayley Graph Explorer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the current Cayley graph visualization with elliptic curve groups and advanced group operations
# Details:
Enhance the existing EnhancedCayleyGraphExplorer component to support elliptic curve groups over finite fields. Add animated point addition operations, subgroup highlighting, and interactive group operation demonstrations. Implement export functionality for SVG/PNG formats and LaTeX code generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test all finite groups up to order 20, verify elliptic curve computations, validate export functionality, and ensure real-time interaction performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend GroupTheory Library for Elliptic Curves [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add elliptic curve group support to the existing GroupTheory library with point arithmetic operations over finite fields
### Details:
Implement EllipticCurveGroup class with point addition, scalar multiplication, and group order computation. Add support for curves of the form y² = x³ + ax + b over finite fields. Include point validation, infinity point handling, and efficient arithmetic operations.

## 2. Implement Animated Point Addition Operations [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create interactive animations for elliptic curve point addition with geometric visualization
### Details:
Build animated visualizations showing the geometric construction of point addition on elliptic curves. Include chord/tangent line drawing, point reflection, and step-by-step operation breakdown. Add playback controls and speed adjustment for educational clarity.

## 3. Add Subgroup Highlighting and Interactive Demonstrations [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement subgroup visualization and interactive group operation demonstrations within the Cayley graph explorer
### Details:
Add subgroup detection and highlighting functionality with distinct colors and visual groupings. Create interactive demonstrations of group properties like closure, associativity, and inverse operations. Include cyclic subgroup generation and coset visualization features.

## 4. Implement Export Functionality and LaTeX Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Add SVG/PNG export capabilities and LaTeX code generation for mathematical documentation
### Details:
Implement high-quality SVG and PNG export functionality for visualizations. Add LaTeX code generation for group operations, curve equations, and point calculations. Include customizable export settings for resolution, styling, and mathematical notation preferences.
