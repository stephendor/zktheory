# Task ID: 11
# Title: Enhance Accessibility and Mobile Experience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance and optimize for tablet interactions
# Details:
Implement comprehensive accessibility features including ARIA labels for mathematical content, keyboard navigation for all interactions, screen reader support with MathML, and high-contrast mode. Optimize touch gestures for tablet use and responsive breakpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test with screen readers and accessibility tools, verify keyboard navigation completeness, validate touch gesture responsiveness, and ensure WCAG compliance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement ARIA Labels and Screen Reader Support for Mathematical Content [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add comprehensive ARIA labels and screen reader support for all mathematical visualizations and content
### Details:
Implement ARIA labels for Cayley graph nodes and edges, TDA visualization elements, and mathematical notation. Add MathML support for LaTeX content to ensure screen readers can interpret mathematical expressions. Create descriptive labels for interactive mathematical components and ensure all mathematical content has alternative text descriptions.

## 2. Implement Complete Keyboard Navigation for Mathematical Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all mathematical tools and visualizations can be fully operated using only keyboard input
### Details:
Implement keyboard navigation for Cayley graph exploration, TDA visualization controls, and mathematical notation editing. Add keyboard shortcuts for common mathematical operations and navigation between mathematical components. Ensure focus indicators are visible and logical tab order for all interactive elements. Support arrow key navigation for graph traversal and mathematical content browsing.

## 3. Implement High-Contrast Mode and Color Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add high-contrast mode and ensure all color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast requirements
### Details:
Implement a high-contrast mode toggle that adjusts color schemes for mathematical visualizations. Ensure all text and mathematical notation meets minimum contrast ratios. Add color-blind friendly palettes for Cayley graphs and TDA visualizations. Implement theme switching that maintains mathematical content readability across different contrast modes.

## 4. Optimize Touch Gestures for Tablet and Mobile Mathematical Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement intuitive touch gestures for mathematical visualization and computation on tablet devices
### Details:
Add pinch-to-zoom for Cayley graphs and TDA visualizations, swipe gestures for navigation between mathematical tools, and touch-friendly controls for mathematical notation editing. Implement responsive breakpoints specifically for tablet interactions. Add haptic feedback for mathematical operations and ensure touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.

## 5. Add Mathematical Content Alternative Formats [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provide alternative formats for mathematical content to improve accessibility
### Details:
Create alternative text descriptions for complex mathematical visualizations. Implement audio descriptions for mathematical concepts and graph structures. Add simplified mathematical notation options for users with cognitive disabilities. Create printable versions of mathematical content with high contrast and clear formatting.

## 6. Implement WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish comprehensive testing procedures to ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
### Details:
Set up automated accessibility testing using tools like axe-core and Lighthouse. Implement manual testing procedures for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast. Create accessibility testing checklist for mathematical content and visualizations. Establish continuous accessibility monitoring and validation in the development pipeline.
