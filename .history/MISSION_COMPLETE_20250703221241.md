## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### New Components Created
```
src/components/blocks/
├── CodeBlock/          # Syntax highlighting with copy
├── MathJax/            # LaTeX equation rendering
├── Chart/              # Interactive data visualizations
└── Mermaid/            # Diagram and flowchart support
```

### Key Configuration Files
- `mkdocs.yml` - Documentation site configuration
- `mkdocs-netlify.toml` - Netlify build settings
- `src/utils/markdown-options.tsx` - Enhanced markdown parsing
- `src/css/blog-enhancements.css` - Custom styling

### Deployment Setup
- **Main Site**: Existing Netlify deployment for zktheory.org
- **Documentation**: New Netlify site for docs.zktheory.org
- **DNS**: CNAME records properly configured

## 🎨 Enhanced Features Demo

### Code Blocks
```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

### Mathematical Equations
- Inline: $E = mc^2$
- Block: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

### Charts & Diagrams
- Interactive charts with Chart.js
- Mermaid diagrams for processes and workflows
- Responsive and accessible visualizations
