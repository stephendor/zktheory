- `src/components/blocks/MathJax/MathJax.tsx` - LaTeX math rendering
- `src/components/blocks/Chart/Chart.tsx` - Chart.js integration
- `src/components/blocks/Mermaid/Mermaid.tsx` - Mermaid diagram rendering

### Core Utilities
- `src/utils/markdown-options.tsx` - Enhanced markdown processing

## Testing Confirmation

All enhanced features work correctly in blog posts:
1. **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
2. **Math equations** (both inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$`)
