# 🔧 Critical Issues Fixed

## ✅ **Blog Posts Not Displaying - RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
- Blog posts were not appearing on the blog page in either the featured or recent posts sections
- The page was loading but showing no content

### **Root Cause:**
- The blog index (`content/pages/blog/index.md`) was referencing a non-existent post: `top-ten-lessons-we-learned.md`
- This post file didn't exist, causing the featured posts section to fail

### **Solution:**
- Updated the featured posts reference in `blog/index.md` to point to the existing `enhanced-blog-demo.md` post
- Verified the `getAllPosts()` filtering is working correctly (only includes blog posts, excludes index)

### **Result:** ✅ **Blog posts now display correctly**

## ✅ **Header Projects Link Dropdown Issue - RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
- Header "Projects" link had reverted to a dropdown (SubNav) with nested links
- Could not access the main projects page directly
- Dropdown was showing non-existent project categories

### **Root Cause:**
- The header configuration (`content/data/header.json`) had a `SubNav` component instead of a simple `Link`
- The SubNav was pointing to paths like `/projects/cybersec`, `/projects/rust`, `/projects/lean` which don't exist

### **Solution:**
- Replaced the `SubNav` component with a simple `Link` component
- Set the Projects link to point directly to `/projects`
- Fixed JSON syntax errors in the header configuration

### **Result:** ✅ **Projects link now works correctly and goes to main projects page**

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### **Working Correctly:**
- ✅ Blog posts display in both featured and recent posts sections
- ✅ Header Projects link goes directly to `/projects` page
- ✅ Projects page loads with proper categorized layout
- ✅ Enhanced blog features still working (math, charts, diagrams, code)
- ✅ Header logo properly sized
- ✅ Search functionality working
- ✅ All navigation links functional

### **Files Modified:**
1. `content/pages/blog/index.md` - Fixed featured posts reference
2. `content/data/header.json` - Replaced SubNav with Link for Projects

### **Navigation Structure Now:**
```
Header:
├── About → /about
├── Blog → /blog
├── Library → /library
└── Projects → /projects ✅ (Fixed)
```

**Both critical issues have been resolved!** The blog is fully functional and the header navigation works correctly. 🎉
