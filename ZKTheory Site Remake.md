$primary-light: #6366f1;

// Secondary: Gold/Amber (Proofs & Verification)
$secondary-dark: #78350f;
$secondary-main: #f59e0b;
$secondary-light: #fbbf24;

// Accent: Emerald (Success/Validity)
$accent-main: #10b981;
$accent-glow: #34d399;

// Neutrals: Sophisticated Grays
$bg-primary: #0f0f14; // Near black with blue tint
$bg-secondary: #1a1a24; // Dark slate
$bg-tertiary: #252533; // Lighter slate
$text-primary: #f9fafb; // Off-white
$text-secondary: #9ca3af; // Muted gray
```

### Geometric Patterns

- **Penrose Tiling**: Non-repeating backgrounds symbolizing uniqueness of proofs
