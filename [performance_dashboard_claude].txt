● I'll continue with the current task which is creating the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration. Let
  me use the file-creator agent to handle this systematically.

● file-creator(Create GitHub Actions CI pipeline)
  ⎿  Done (22 tool uses · 87.6k tokens · 7m 8.9s)                                                             

● Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that integrates seamlessly
  with the existing mathematical performance monitoring framework. Let me mark this task as completed and move
   on to the next one.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Enhance existing performance framework for mathematical computations 
     ☒ Implement WASM computation benchmarking for TDA and Cayley operations
     ☒ Create performance baseline management with statistical analysis
     ☒ Add performance regression detection with CI integration
     ☒ Create GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration
     ☐ Set up parallel test execution (unit, E2E, visual, performance)
     ☐ Build performance dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
     ☐ Configure test result aggregation and artifact management
     ☐ Add performance gates and mathematical validation in CI
     ☐ Enhance mathematical validation framework with theorem checking
     ☐ Implement LaTeX rendering validation (KaTeX vs MathJax)
     ☐ Create graph visualization validation for mathematical accuracy
     ☐ Build mathematical proof and theorem verification system

● Great! Now I need to continue with setting up parallel test execution. Since the CI pipeline included the
  parallel test structure, I should now focus on enhancing the test configurations and ensuring proper test
  segregation. Let me work on task 14.5.2.

● test-writer-fixer(Set up parallel test execution)
  ⎿  Done (28 tool uses · 98.5k tokens · 10m 32.5s)                                                           

● Excellent! I can see the package.json has been updated with all the parallel test execution scripts. Let me
  mark task 14.5.2 as completed and continue with the next task - configuring test result aggregation and
  artifact management.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Enhance existing performance framework for mathematical computations 
     ☒ Implement WASM computation benchmarking for TDA and Cayley operations

     ☐ Build mathematical proof and theorem verification system

● Now I'll work on configuring test result aggregation and artifact management to complete the testing
  infrastructure.

● test-results-analyzer(Configure test result aggregation)
  ⎿  Update Todos
     ☒ Create comprehensive test result aggregation framework with collection, analysis, and reporting capabilities
     ☐ Set up intelligent artifact management system for performance data, visual regression screenshots, and 
       mathematical computation reports
     ☐ Implement cross-test analysis to correlate unit test failures with performance regressions
     ☐ Create mathematical-specific reporting framework for group theory validation, TDA accuracy metrics, and
       LaTeX rendering
     ☐ Enhance CI integration with proper artifact upload/download and unified HTML/JSON report generation
     ☐ Implement performance trend analysis with historical tracking and baseline comparison
     ☐ Create failure pattern analysis system to identify common failure patterns across mathematical operations

> I would like you to check the componenents constructed for Task 10 because I believe you will need to 
  integrate this work with that performance monitoring dashboard. It might be good to make any adjustments 
  needed at this point

● You're absolutely right! Let me examine the components from Task 10 to understand the existing performance
  monitoring dashboard and ensure proper integration.

● Search(pattern: "**/Task10*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "**/*dashboard*")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/components/performance/PerformanceDashboard.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 73 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/components/performance/**")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+r to expand)

> /export

● I see there's an existing performance dashboard from Task 10. Let me read these components to understand the
   current architecture before proceeding with the test result aggregation.

● Read(src/components/performance/PerformanceCharts.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 226 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/components/performance/PerformanceMetrics.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 191 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/components/performance/DashboardControls.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 305 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can see the existing performance dashboard architecture from Task 10. I need to integrate the
   test result aggregation and artifact management with this existing framework. Let me enhance it to work
  with our comprehensive testing infrastructure.
